Weather Report
This weather report website is a simple and intuitive web application that allows users to check real-time weather conditions for their current location. The site uses the browser’s Geolocation API to automatically detect the user’s latitude and longitude, and then fetches relevant weather data from a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap).
